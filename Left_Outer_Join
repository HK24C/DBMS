LEFT OUTER Join for tables A and B will always return all records from table A even if matching record is not found in table B as per the join condition. For records where match is found the result set is exactly same as the inner join result. However for non matching records all columns from table B appear as NULL in the result. Let us understand this join using Employee and Computer tables:
Computer Table
COMPID	MAKE	MODEL	MYEAR
1001	Dell	Vostro	2013
1002	Dell	Precision	2014
1003	Lenovo	Edge	2013
1004	Lenovo	Horizon	2014

QUERRY:
SELECT ID, ENAME, E.COMPID AS E_COMPID, C.COMPID AS C_COMPID, MODEL
FROM Employee E LEFTOUTER JOIN Computer C ON E.COMPID = C.COMPID

ID	ENAME	E_COMPID	C_COMPID	MODEL
1	James Potter	1001	1001	Vostro
2	Ethan McCarty	NULL	NULL	NULL
3	Emily Rayner	1002	1002	Precision
4	Jack Abraham	NULL	NULL	NULL
5	Ayaz Mohammad	1003	1003	Edge
